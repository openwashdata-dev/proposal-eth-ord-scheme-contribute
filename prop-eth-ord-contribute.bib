  abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), through the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), are responsible for global monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). The SDGs represent a fundamental shift in household WASH monitoring with a new focus on service levels and the incorporation of hygiene. This article reflects on the process of establishing SDG baselines and the methods used to generate national, regional and global estimates for the new household WASH indicators. The JMP 2017 update drew on over 3000 national data sources, primarily household surveys (n = 1443), censuses (n = 309) and administrative data (n = 1494). Whereas most countries could generate estimates for basic drinking water and basic sanitation, fewer countries could report on basic handwashing facilities, water quality and the disposal of waste from onsite sanitation. Based on data for 96 and 84 countries, respectively, the JMP estimates that globally 2.1 billion (29\%) people lacked safely managed drinking water services and 4.5 billion (61\%) lacked safely managed sanitation services in 2015. The expanded JMP inequalities database also finds substantial disparities by wealth and sub-national regions. The SDG baselines for household WASH reveal the scale of the challenge associated with achieving universal safely managed services and the substantial acceleration needed in many countries to achieve even basic services for everyone by 2030. Many countries have begun to localise the global SDG targets and are investing in data collection to address the SDG data gaps, whether through the integration of new elements in household surveys or strengthening collection and reporting of information through administrative and regulatory systems.},

  abstract = {International monitoring of drinking water and sanitation shapes awareness of countries' needs and informs policy, implementation and research efforts to extend and improve services. The Millennium Development Goals established global targets for drinking water and sanitation access; progress towards these targets, facilitated by international monitoring, has contributed to reducing the global disease burden and increasing quality of life. The experiences of the MDG period generated important lessons about the strengths and limitations of current approaches to defining and monitoring access to drinking water and sanitation. The methods by which the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF tracks access and progress are based on analysis of data from household surveys and linear regression modelling of these results over time.  These methods provide nationally representative and internationally comparable insights into the drinking water and sanitation facilities used by populations worldwide, but also have substantial limitations: current methods do not address water quality, equity of access,  or extra-household services. Improved statistical methods are needed to better model temporal trends. This article describes and critically reviews JMP methods in detail for the first time. It also explores the impact of, and future directions for, international monitoring of drinking water and sanitation.},

  abstract = {Introduction Global access to safe drinking water and sanitation has improved dramatically during the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) period. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in progress between countries and inequality within countries. Methods We assessed countries' temporal patterns in access to drinking water and sanitation using publicly available data. We then classified countries using non-linear modeling techniques as having one of the following trajectories: 100\% coverage, linear growth, linear decline, no change, saturation, acceleration, deceleration, negative acceleration, or negative deceleration. We further assessed the degree to which temporal profiles follow a sigmoidal pattern and how these patterns might vary within a given country between rural and urban settings. Results Among countries with more than 10 data points, between 15\% and 38\% showed a non-linear trajectory, depending on the indicator. Overall, countries' progress followed a sigmoidal trend, but some countries are making better progress and some worse progress than would be expected. We highlight several countries that are not on track to meet the MDG for water or sanitation, but whose access is accelerating, suggesting better performance during the coming years. Conversely, we also highlight several countries that have made sufficient progress to meet the MDG target, but in which access is decelerating. Discussion Patterns were heterogeneous and non-linearity was common. Characterization of these heterogeneous patterns will help policy makers allocate resources more effectively. For example, policy makers can identify countries that could make use of additional resources or might be in need of additional institutional capacity development to properly manage resources; this will be essential to meet the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals.},

Using existing Joint Monitoring Programme facility classifications and secondary data on piped water access, a Service Typology was developed to classify and quantify the primary emptying service needs of household level onsite sanitation facilities. Facilities in six Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) regions were classified as Emptiable (faecal sludge can be removed either via Mechanized or Non-Mechanized means) or Unemptiable. Of the 722 million household level sanitation facilities assessed in these regions, 32\% were found to be emptiable via Mechanized means, 50\% via Non-Mechanized means and 18\% were found to be Unemptiable pits. The volume (by number of facilities) and density (as a proportion of the full population) of each service type were estimated by SDG region and by country. Results from this study provide background data on the role of emptying sanitation facilities in achieving SDG6, and can be incorporated into investment priorities, policy framing, technology development, infrastructure development, and targeted behaviour change strategies.},

The methods employed are based on analysis of data from household surveys and linear regression modelling of these results over time. However, there is evidence of non-linearity in the JMP data. In addition, the compositional nature of these data is not taken into consideration. This article seeks to address these two previous shortcomings in order to produce more accurate estimates. Methods We employed an isometric log-ratio transformation designed for compositional data. We applied linear and non-linear time regressions to both the original and the transformed data. Specifically, different modelling alternatives for non-linear trajectories were analysed, all of which are based on a generalized additive model (GAM). Results and discussion Non-linear methods, such as GAM, may be used for modelling non-linear trajectories in the JMP data. This projection method is particularly suited for data-rich countries. Moreover, the ilr transformation of compositional data is conceptually sound and fairly simple to implement. It helps improve the performance of both linear and non-linear regression models, specifically in the occurrence of extreme data points, i.e. when coverage rates are near either 0\% or 100\%.},

Service levels add up to 100\%; therefore, they are compositional data (CoDa). Despite evidence of zero value, missing data and outliers in the sources of information, the treatment of these irregularities with different statistical techniques has not yet been analyzed for CoDa in the WASH sector. Thus, the results may present biased estimates, and the decisions based on these results will not necessarily be appropriate. In this article, we therefore: i) evaluate methodological imputation alternatives that address the problem of having either zero values or missing values, or both simultaneously; and ii) propose the need to complement the point-to-point identification of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) with other robust alternatives, to deal with outliers depending on the number of data points. These suggestions have been considered here using statistics for CoDa with isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation. A selection of illustrative cases is presented to compare performance of different alternatives.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of access to water and sanitation services is stipulated in Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6.1 and 6.2, respectively. The monitoring is carried out with a global, regional and country vision. However, in most developing countries, decentralization of services in water and sanitation management has tended to the sub-national level or has shared responsibilities between national and sub-national governments. Management at the subnational level becomes more important, since everything that is done there will impact the objectives and goals of the country. However, little or nothing progress has been made in harmonizing global indicators with those at the subnational level. Therefore, in this study we have proposed a way to disaggregate information and form WASH ladders at the subnational level. The results show using disaggregated data to interpolate models at the subnational level requires overcoming three main points: the validation of the data through statistical methods, interpolation techniques that go according to the compositional characteristics of the data and the incorporation of the uncertainty of the data into the model results. It also shows that subnational behavior is heterogeneous, which a general analysis does not capture correctly, i.e., there is a masking effect of subnational trends that the country's trend does not represent. However, these have been exceptional cases in some specific categories. Finally, the applicability of non-linear models is contrasted in a broader context, an issue that is still under discussion for its application to global monitoring. This study also provides a way to disaggregate information from the global to the sub-national level, allowing any sector analyst to replicate the methodology in a broader context.},
