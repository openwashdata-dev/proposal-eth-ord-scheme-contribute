# Info

## Website

- Measure 1: Calls for Field-Specific Actions
- https://ethrat.ch/en/measure-1-calls-for-field-specific-actions/
- Contribute projects will help researchers to contribute to existing open communities built around ORD. They will validate their integration with existing infrastructures (including international ones) and focus on their potential to advance the scientific  impact of the field as well as their technical quality.

## Email

- Funding for “Contribute projects” aims at:
    - Contributing a **piece of software, data, hardware**, etc., which **simplifies** an established ORD practice, develops its **research potential**, or otherwise improves it.
    - Curating or otherwise improving available ORD, for example, by updating existing data to **adapt it to the evolution of ORD practices** or by linking different ORD datasets or by collecting and curating existing data before uploading it to an ORD platform.
    - Providing **community services**, such as the organization of a **workshop** or training, or **coordination** for the development of an ORD standard.
    
Funding is available for projects of up to 12 months with an overall budget that must be CHF 30’000.
