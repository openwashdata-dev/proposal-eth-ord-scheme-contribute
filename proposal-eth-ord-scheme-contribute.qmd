## Email

- Funding for “Contribute projects” aims at:
    - Contributing a **piece of software, data, hardware**, etc., which **simplifies** an established ORD practice, develops its **research potential**, or otherwise improves it.
    - Curating or otherwise improving available ORD, for example, by updating existing data to **adapt it to the evolution of ORD practices** or by linking different ORD datasets or by collecting and curating existing data before uploading it to an ORD platform.
    - Providing **community services**, such as the organization of a **workshop** or training, or **coordination** for the development of an ORD standard.

## Background and motivation

Please explain which aim(s) of the ORD “contribute projects” you seek to address:

- Contributing a piece of software, data, hardware, etc., which simplifies an established ORD practice, develops its research potential, or otherwise improves it. 

- Curating or otherwise improving available ORD. For example, by updating existing data to adapt it to the evolution of ORD practices. Or by linking different ORD datasets. Or by collecting and curating existing data before uploading it to an ORD platform.

- Providing community services, such as the organization of a workshop or training, or coordination for the development of an ORD standard.

### UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)

The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) was established in 1990 to monitor global progress on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene. The JMP produces estimates for a total of 26 indicators related to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Estimates are produced using linear regression models at the country, regional, and the global levels [@who/unicefjointprogrammeforwatersupplysanitsationandhygienejmp2018jmp]. 

### JMP modelled estimates (data output)

The produced estimates are the only available source of comprehensive and internationally-comparable information on WASH coverage. Data from JMP are also used in reports used to estimate the global burden of disease associated with water and sanitation and to assess the cost-effectiveness, benefit-cost ratio, global expenditure, and investment needs in global drinking water and sanitation [@bartram2014globala]. More recently the data has been used to quantify the service needs for 772 million onsite sanitation facilities [@greene2021role].

### JMP data input 

Every two years the JMP updates its global databases to incorporate the latest available national data. [@who/unicefjointprogrammeforwatersupplysanitsationandhygienejmp2021metadata]. The data is collected from various sources, including censuses, household surveys, administrative data, and others (e.g. research). Data formats between these sources are highly heterogenous, and a significant amount of effort is invested into extracting data from each source and bringing it into a standardised format. 

### JMP Country Files

So-called JMP Country Files are used for recording these data inputs in a hidden sheet of a Microsoft Excel workbook. A statistical analysis software package (Stata 14.0) imports the for all the 232 countries, areas, and territories for which data are available, and runs the estimation model. The resulting estimates are exported back to each country file in another hidden sheet, which in turn feeds a sheet where estimates  are produced for the full set of indicators. The result is one JMP Country File for each country. While the modelled estimates are accessible through a World File for all countries, the underlying data input are only accessible through individual country files. 

### Use cases

The JMP uses this input data specifically to produce indicator estimates for SDG indicators 6.1 and 6.2, but there is great potential for unforeseen use cases (e.g. research, teaching, joining with other data, etc.). These could be enabled by making the data readily accessible in a form that follows FAIR data principles [@wilkinson2016fair]. There are a range of published studies, which have used the input data, but each of their own would have gone through the effort of extracting and combining all data into a single dataframe for analysis. Further, it is difficult to identify puclications that have made use of the JMP input database, because there isn't a single DOI that could be cited, nor a clear license applied to the the data.  

### Problem Statement

We seek to address this unused potential by contributing software and data packages that address the aims of this call. Using open-source R Statistical Software, we will curate the data carefully and add valuable variables/categories to the exisiting data that allow for new and unexpected types of analyses. We seek to address the aim of providing a community service by organising pracitical workshops and training on the developed software and data packages. This allows for engagement with the published data on variety of levels and provides a highly relevant dataset that also opens the opportuntities for people to see "what is behind the curtain". 

In some preliminary work, we have started to develop R scripts that extract the data from the JMP Country Files and combine them into a single dataframe [reference: washr R Package]. The database contains xxxxx data points from xxxxx variety of sources. We have further started to develop R scripts that replicate the regression models of the JMP using documented JMP methods, but quickly realised that using the JMP Stata script for replicating the analysis would be highly advantagoues. A research study is ongoing which applies alterntative statistical models to the input data. 


## ORD project plan

- Which specific gap(s) in knowledge will your work address? Why is your approach innovative?

- What questions will the project answer? What specific outcomes will you focus on? 

- Which strategy will you use to address the questions you seek to answer?

### WP1: Document and publish R data package `jmpraw`

Goal: Make data readily accessible to enable researchers and practitioners to utilize powerful data

We have extracted the data contained in the JMP MS Excel country files and produced a documented data package that can be readily accessed using the R statistical computing software. 

**Activities:**

1. Write up documentation that describes the origin of data and structure that it is provided in
2. Prepare at least two use cases as "vignettes" that can be published together with the data 
3. Publish data, documentation and "vignettes" as R Package using workflows described in [Ref R Packages]
4. Use packages of the R environment to publish R Package as a public website, including all documentation and vignettes

### WP2: Prepare and document R software Package `jmpmodel`

Goal: Develop open-source software to support transparent documentation of modelling activities

**Activities:**

1. Work with the JMP team to transfer the current STATA script into an R script
2. Prepare a set of R functions that achieve all necessary data manipulation, modelling and visualisation steps 
3. Write up complete documentation for developed R functions 
4. Publish R functions as a complete piece of software as an R Package as described in [Ref R Packages]
5. Use packages of the R environment to publish R Package as a public website, including all documentation and vignettes

### WP3: Collaborate with the JMP to promote use and maintenance of R packages

Goal: Seek active collaboration on package development to increase potential usage and long-term maintenance of data and software package.

**Activities:**

1. Identify JMP team member who actively contributes to WP1 and WP2
2. Work with the JMP team to transfer the current STATA script into an R script
3. Continuously check-in with JMP team member and general JMP team to update on progress and share intermediate products
4. Host a 4-hour training/workshop with key members of the JMP in Geneva and/or New York to demonstrate the potential use of the developed R Packages for JMP modeling activities

### WP4: Dissemination
**Activities:**

1. Host a public participatory live coding online workshop for the openwashdata community to showcase the data packages
2. Publish open source training materials from online workshop for others to use for own teaching activities (e.g. Caetano Canada WASH thingie, University of Leeds, etc.)






### WP4: Host a 3-hour participatory online training to market use of R packages
