# Info

## Website

- Measure 1: Calls for Field-Specific Actions
- https://ethrat.ch/en/measure-1-calls-for-field-specific-actions/
- Contribute projects will help researchers to contribute to existing open communities built around ORD. They will validate their integration with existing infrastructures (including international ones) and focus on their potential to advance the scientific  impact of the field as well as their technical quality.

## Email

- Funding for “Contribute projects” aims at:
    - Contributing a **piece of software, data, hardware**, etc., which **simplifies** an established ORD practice, develops its **research potential**, or otherwise improves it.
    - Curating or otherwise improving available ORD, for example, by updating existing data to **adapt it to the evolution of ORD practices** or by linking different ORD datasets or by collecting and curating existing data before uploading it to an ORD platform.
    - Providing **community services**, such as the organization of a **workshop** or training, or **coordination** for the development of an ORD standard.
    
Funding is available for projects of up to 12 months with an overall budget that must be CHF 30’000.

## Copy from CO WASH Symposium abstract


In our first use case, we reproduce indicator estimates for SDG 6.2 using R. The JMP uses linear regression models to produce these estimates for reasons including the often small number of data points per indicator, reliability over time, and comparability between countries. In our research, we have experimented with alternative statistical models that could be applied to some countries. 

In this session, we will introduce the "jmpraw" R data package and show a live coding demonstration of how it can be used to reproduce indicator estimates. We will present key results from our research on applying alternative non-linear models to produce indicator estimates.

This session highlights how making data accessible in a format that follows FAIR data principles can positively benefit other people's work. It supports the mission of the Colorado WASH Symposium by applying tools that are open and free for anyone to use. 



### UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)

The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (the JMP) was established in 1990. Since then, a database of nearly 20'000 data points has been established for sanitation alone.

The data is collected from various sources, including censuses, household surveys, administrative data, and others (e.g. research). Data structures between these sources are highly heterogenous, and a significant amount of effort is invested into extracting data from each source and bringing it into a defined format. Anyone can access the result of this work through the so-called "country files", which are MS Excel workbooks containing each country's raw data. 

While the JMP uses this input data specifically to produce indicator estimates for SDG indicators 6.1 and 6.2, there is great potential for unforeseen use cases (e.g. research, teaching, joining with other data, etc.). These could be enabled by making the data readily accessible in a form that follows FAIR data principles. 

Availability of data is one of the key constraints within the WASH sector, and from observing current trends, it becomes a key focus area for organisations (e.g. UNICEF Game Plan
to Reach Safely Managed Sanitation; WHO monitoring of the safe management of on-site sanitation (SMOSS) services).

## openwashdata community

- engagement with the published data on variety of levels
- highly relevant dataset that also opens the opportuntities for people to see "what is behind the curtain"
- motivation to provide high-quality standardised data that feeds into the the JMP raw database
- use for training materials or own research

## research

- applying alternative models

## Problem Statement

## ORD project plan

- Please describe your project design, including how it addresses the aim(s) of the ORD “contribute projects” described above. Please refer to the scientific literature as well as any preliminary, unpublished results that have informed your approach. 

- Which specific gap(s) in knowledge will your work address? Why is your approach innovative?

- What questions will the project answer? What specific outcomes will you focus on? 

- Which strategy will you use to address the questions you seek to answer?

### WP1: Document and publish R data package `jmpraw`

Goal: Make data readily accessible to enable researchers and practitioners to utilize powerful data

We have extracted the data contained in the JMP MS Excel country files and produced a documented data package that can be readily accessed using the R statistical computing software. 

**Activities:**

1. Write up documentation that describes the origin of data and structure that it is provided in
2. Prepare at least two use cases as "vignettes" that can be published together with the data 
3. Publish data, documentation and "vignettes" as R Package using workflows described in [Ref R Packages]
4. Use packages of the R environment to publish R Package as a public website, including all documentation and vignettes

### WP2: Prepare and document R software Package `jmpmodel`

Goal: Develop open-source software to support transparent documentation of modelling activities

**Activities:**

1. Work with the JMP team to transfer the current STATA script into an R script
2. Prepare a set of R functions that achieve all necessary data manipulation, modelling and visualisation steps 
3. Write up complete documentation for developed R functions 
4. Publish R functions as a complete piece of software as an R Package as described in [Ref R Packages]
5. Use packages of the R environment to publish R Package as a public website, including all documentation and vignettes

### WP3: Collaborate with the JMP to promote use and maintenance of R packages

Goal: Seek active collaboration on package development to increase potential usage and long-term maintenance of data and software package.

**Activities:**

1. Identify JMP team member who actively contributes to WP1 and WP2
2. Work with the JMP team to transfer the current STATA script into an R script
3. Continuously check-in with JMP team member and general JMP team to update on progress and share intermediate products
4. Host a 4-hour training/workshop with key members of the JMP in Geneva and/or New York to demonstrate the potential use of the developed R Packages for JMP modeling activities

### WP4: Dissemination
**Activities:**

1. Host a public participatory live coding online workshop for the openwashdata community to showcase the data packages
2. Publish open source training materials from online workshop for others to use for own teaching activities (e.g. Caetano Canada WASH thingie, University of Leeds, etc.)






### WP4: Host a 3-hour participatory online training to market use of R packages
